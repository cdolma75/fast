## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge I encountered in creating this submission was debugging my program, I wasn’t able to find the console log, it says in the instruction that pressing f12 can open the console log for many browsers, and I did try pressing that button and it didn’t open anything. The console log is important because it is where I can print anything or any part of the program to see any mistakes but I was not able to find and open the console log to do that which made it a little hard to see if my program was running smoothly or not. To overcome this, I simply follow the clear instruction given and check my code each by each, and with all parts looking good and meeting their requirements in the instruction, I ran the program. Running the program without the console log but just the clear instruction, using the many images that were given, and even a very clear video of how the program suppose to look like, I was able to make this program successfully.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Not a question but after completing my submission I am very excited and curious to learn more about web development that has so many programming languages involved. Things about this program that interested me a lot are definitely putting the chart like as for the last step on 9, putting our logic which was shown in the chart into programming languages.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had few more hours to work on this project, the changes I will make will mainly be based upon making it more fun in order to attract players. This program was simple with a total of eight clues to guess, I would love to add the feature of different types of level examples like easy, medium, and advance. As the level goes up, there will be more boxes with more colors and sound and mainly more clues to guess which in my opinion will be very fun to play. With having different levels, any age will be able to play the game which fulfills my goal to attract more and more players to play this game.
